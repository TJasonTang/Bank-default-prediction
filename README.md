# Bank-default-prediction
Gradient Boosting classifier to predict bank default, 

including Data Preprocessing:

Exploratory Data Analysis: A deep dive into the data has provided valuable insights into the factors affecting loan defaults.

Modeling: I've employed advanced techniques, including handling class imbalances through oversampling, to ensure our model predicts with high accuracy.

Evaluation: Comprehensive metrics have been provided to understand the model's performance.

Demo: There is a Demo in the last section where you can change the features in the Dictionary from Preprocess_input function, and the last script will use the previous preprocess input to predict Whether the Load will default or not.
